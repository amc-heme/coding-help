some R code that I need help getting into shape

This is a code block I am currently using to try to interogate mutations that are specifically found in the myeloid lineage but not the lymphoid lineage.  Mutations that fit this profile are hard to find because the variant data is very sparse and the expression of genes also varies across these lineages.  It is typical to find a mutation that has coverage in a few hundred myeloid cells but no coverage at all in lymphoid cells due to expression.  This code that I am currently using for this is very crude and currently only allows looking at one mutation at a time.  Goals for the code as well explanations of why I am doing things a certain way are written in the code along the way.  Any help or comments would be appreciated.
